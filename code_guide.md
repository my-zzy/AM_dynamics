# Code Organization

# 1. First: Think in Layers (Very Important)

Your equations naturally split into **three layers**:

### (A) Math utilities (stateless)
Basic operations:
- quaternion → rotation matrix  
- quaternion derivative  
- cross product, skew matrix  
- transformations  

👉 These should NOT know anything about “robot”, “link”, etc.

---

### (B) Kinematics layer
Implements:
- forward kinematics  
- velocity recursion  
- acceleration recursion  

👉 This layer computes:
- \( p_i, R_i \)
- \( \omega_i, \dot{p}_i \)
- \( \dot{\omega}_i, \ddot{p}_i \)

---

### (C) Dynamics layer
Implements:
- Newton–Euler equations (your last section)

👉 This layer computes:
- forces \( f_i \)
- torques \( \tau_i \)
- base dynamics

---

### (D) System wrapper (top level)
This connects everything:
- state → kinematics → dynamics → state derivative

---

# 2. Suggested Folder / File Structure

Keep it simple but scalable:

```
ams/
├── math_utils.py
├── kinematics.py
├── dynamics.py
├── model.py
├── state.py
└── simulator.py
```

---

# 3. Design Each Module Properly

## 3.1 `state.py` — Define Your State Clearly

This is **critical**.

Your full state should include:

- platform:
  - position \( p_A \)
  - velocity \( \dot{p}_A \)
  - quaternion \( q_A \)
  - angular velocity \( \omega_A \)

- manipulator:
  - joint angles \( \theta \)
  - joint velocities \( \dot{\theta} \)

👉 Keep it as a **structured object**, not loose arrays.

---

## 3.2 `math_utils.py` — Pure Math

Functions like:

- quaternion → rotation matrix  
- quaternion derivative (your Ω matrix equation)  
- cross product helper  
- maybe skew matrix  

⚠️ Rule:
> No robot-specific logic here.

---

## 3.3 `kinematics.py` — Recursive Engine

This is where your equations (velocity & acceleration recursion) live.

### Responsibilities:

1. Forward kinematics  
   Compute:
   - \( R_i \), \( p_i \)

2. Velocity recursion  
   Using:
   - \( \omega_i = \omega_{i-1} + R_i \dot{\theta}_i z \)

3. Acceleration recursion  
   Using your equations:
   - angular acceleration  
   - linear acceleration  

---

### Key Design Idea

👉 Store results in arrays:

Instead of:
```
p1, p2, p3 ...
```

Use:
```
p[i], R[i], omega[i], ...
```

This lets you loop cleanly.

---

## 3.4 `dynamics.py` — Newton–Euler

This part should be **two passes**:

---

### Forward pass (already done in kinematics)

You already computed:
- \( \omega_i \)
- \( \dot{\omega}_i \)
- \( \ddot{p}_{c_i} \)

---

### Backward pass (forces & torques)

Loop **from end-effector back to base**:

For each link:
- compute \( f_i \)
- compute \( \tau_i \)

👉 This directly maps to your equations:
- force balance  
- torque balance  

---

### Important Design Choice

Use arrays:

```
f[i], tau[i]
```

And iterate:
```
for i in reversed(range(n)):
```

---

## 3.5 `model.py` — Parameters

This file stores:

- masses \( m_i \)
- inertia matrices \( I_i \)
- link geometry (Craig params)
- COM offsets

👉 Keep ALL constants here.

---

## 3.6 `simulator.py` — The Glue

This is your main function:

```
x_dot = f(x, u)
```

Pipeline:

1. unpack state  
2. kinematics → compute all positions, velocities, accelerations  
3. dynamics → compute forces & torques  
4. compute:
   - \( \ddot{p}_A \)
   - \( \dot{\omega}_A \)
   - \( \ddot{\theta} \)
   - quaternion derivative  

---

# 4. Execution Flow (Mental Model)

Every timestep:

```
state
  ↓
kinematics (forward recursion)
  ↓
accelerations (still forward)
  ↓
dynamics (backward recursion)
  ↓
state derivatives
```

---

# 5. Key Pitfalls (You WILL hit these)

### 1. Quaternion drift
You must:
- normalize quaternion every step

---

### 2. Frame consistency
Everything must be:
- either ALL in world frame (your equations are)
- or ALL in body frame

👉 You are using world frame → stick to it.

---

### 3. Cross product mistakes
Most bugs come from:
- wrong order: \( a \times b \neq b \times a \)

---

### 4. Index confusion
Links:
- base = 0
- links = 1…n

Be consistent.

---

# 6. Minimal Development Strategy

Don’t implement everything at once.

### Step-by-step:

1. Only platform dynamics (no arm)
2. Add 1-link manipulator
3. Add full recursion
4. Add backward dynamics
5. Validate with simple cases

---

# 7. Final Insight

What you’re implementing is essentially:

👉 a **floating-base rigid body dynamics engine**

Very similar to:
- RBDL
- Pinocchio
- MuJoCo internals

If your structure is clean, later you can:
- plug into MPC
- plug into RL
- swap integrators

---

If you want next step, I can:
- help you map **each equation → exact function responsibility**
- or help you design **state vector layout for RL / MPC**
